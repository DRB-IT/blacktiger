blacktiger
==========

Server implementation for blacktiger.

In order to run integration tests Virtualbox and Vagrant needs to be installed locally. Afterwards it will be possible to execute 'vagrant up' in order to startup a virtual machine with preconfigured Asterisk and mysql which the integration tests can use.
